# Daily Stand-up

It is a short meeting that is held each day of the agile development. In this meeting, the contributors in the development team will answer key questions and an optional social question.\
****\
****This will repeat until each contributor has answered the following questions.

### ðŸ¥… Goals

1. Bring awareness of the progress done towards the sprint goal, and the sprint backlog.
2. Surface any impediments to one or more team members' contributions.
3. Maintain contact between remote team members to reduce social barriers to collaboration.

### Participation

The entire team should attend the stand-up. Anyone that worked on a task towards the sprint work should answer the three questions. It would be up to the team to decide if they would like updates from members that are not directly working against sprint task work (i.e. Product Owners and Project Manager).

* Process Manager/Delivery Manager (Required)
* Product Owner (Optional)
* Project Manager (Required)
* Team Lead + Contributors (Required)

### Facilitator

Delivery Manager / PM / Dev Lead are recommended that they will facilitate or lead the daily stand-up.

### Stand-up length

The length depends on the team size. However, we can shorten the length if we have a short answer to each key question.

* 15-30+ minutes - Too long and needs improvement
* 10-15 minutes - Satisfactory
* 5-10 minutes - Better
* 1-5 minutes - Best

### Time to share updates

How long did the contributors begin sharing their updates after the scheduled time?

* 0-1 minutes - Superb!
* 1-5 minutes - Good
* 5+ minutes - Needs improvement

### Keynotes

1. Speak to the task directly, make your answer short.\
   \
   **For example**\
   _"I finish the card `TASK-01` yesterday which was to expose `Query.accounts`; I will be working on `TASK-02`, which is to work on the CI pipeline"_.
2. If the contributor did an unplanned work because he can't refer to a card, then create a card under the related prioritized story.
3. Contributors should raise questions or issues after all team members finish answering the key questions. The facilitator should open the discussion to anyone who wants to raise questions or issues. **This part of the meeting is optional**.
4. Start on time, begin answering questions as close to the scheduled time as possible. Avoid chit-chat or waiting on all team members to join. Starting immediately will help ensure stand-ups remain effective and useful over time.
5. Same time every weekday, the meeting time should be mutually agreed upon by the contributors and should take into consideration the working schedules, power interruptions, and other factors so that every team member can reasonably participate.
6. Contributors unable to attend could provide a written update through the shared channel in Slack before the stand-up. This way the facilitator could read aloud the update in the meeting.
7. Take note of every card being created after the stand-up. This could be an indicator of how much unplanned work is being done. If creating a new card after stand-up becomes a routine, then this could also be an indicator of the story is at higher risk of not being completed.

> **ðŸ’¡ Advisory Note:**
>
> \
> If a contributor provides an update without referring to a card, ask the contributer what card.\
> \
> If no card then create one.
