# Columns

### To Do

These are priority cards moved from the Backlog and ready for development. The team should follow their own Definition of Ready.

### In Progress

These are cards that are ongoing.

### Ready For QA

These are cards ready to be tested.

### QA In Progress

In this column, SQA will write an automation test and manually test the story card.

Shifting the Automated E2E Test to the left is recommended for every project.

Things the team should do before shifting-left testing:

1. Make sure that all acceptance criteria are clear.
2. SQA should collaborate what are the required backdoor variables to bypass real transactions.
3. Developers should help QA with any inquiries from them during **QA In Progress**.

These are the things that you do not consider shift-left testing:

1. No full-time Software QA Engineer (SQA).
2. The story card is not automated test-worthy.

### QA Failed

These are the cards that failed on testing.

### Done

These are cards that passed the testing phase. These are cards that got tagged using `Git`. The team should follow their own Definition of Done.
