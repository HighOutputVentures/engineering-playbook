# Epics

Are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).

### Why should we create it?

To categorize and organize common pieces for the required work into a shippable piece.

### When should we create it?

When there are initiatives or features that can be broken into deliverable pieces.

### Difference between Epic and the other issue types?

Other card issue types describe a single piece of work, while epics on the other, are used to describe a group of issues related to the same, larger body of work.

### Writing the `Title`

Make it shorter and easy to understand, you can initially name it like this.

**Example(s)**

```
- Post

- Notifications

- Member Management
```

> **NOTE**: However, there are some instances that you want to further narrow down the scope to fit on a release cycle

**Example(s)**

```
- Bookmark Post

- View All Read Notifications

- Update Members
```

### Writing a description guidelines

An elevator pitch (value statement) that describes the epic in a clear and concise way.

#### You can follow this kind of format

```markdown
For <customers>
Who <do something>
The <solution>
is a <something - the "how">
that <provides this value>
unlike <competitor, current solution, non-existing solution>
our solution <does something better -- the why?>
```
