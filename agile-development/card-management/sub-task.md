# Sub-task

This is to further break down Story Cards into a fine-grained unit of work. This also serves as a guide for developers.

### Naming title guidelines

Make the title _imperative_[1](../03-card-management/02\_SUB\_TASK\_CARD.md#terms).

Example(s)

`Add an GraphQL endpoint to update a pending item`

### Writing a description guidelines

It should define the purpose and the additional details for this task.

**Example(s)**

`The item can be updated when the field, status, is PENDING.`

`The update would return an error message if the status is not PENDING.`
