# Kanban from the start

We're using the Kanban framework as a baseline when starting or initializing a project.

### Why Kanban?

1. Start lean and with minimum required processes.
2. Encourage leadership at all levels
3. It does not overhaul existing workflows and processes but emphasizes small gradual changes.
4. It is easy to adapt depending on the team's proposed changes. It is possible to adopt a hybrid with scrum, or gradually to SAFe, make a strict path using DAD, and etc.
