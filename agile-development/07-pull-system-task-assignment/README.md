# Pull System Task Assignment

## What?
It's a type of lean technique for reducing waste on any development and production process.

## Why?
Is to develop on actual demand not on the forecasts. It enables optimization on resources.

- Scale the optimal capacity of your team
- Deliver work items much master
- Reduce wastes of resources
- Increase productivity
- Improve flow efficiency

## How does it work?
Add the priority items on `To Do` column. Let the devs take one card at a time to In Progress.

## How can we do it effectively?

### Control the Work in Progress
Add card limit on columns that mattered the most. This is to say that To Do and In Progress SHOULD have limits, so that you can take the prioritized task from the Backlog to In Progress. On the other hand, developers help each to finish task in the In Progress so that they could add another task from To Do.

> Grab task when you're ready


### Apply Pull Cue
We can do this when a new card move from Backlog to To Do. This is to indicate that this card is ready for development.

There are some cases when cue is for QA to test the "development done" cards.


> NOTE: It works well with Kanban Framework in Agile Development.
