# Agile Metrics

### Main Metrics

1. **Cycle Time** - is the time your team spends actively on the client's request
2. **Change of Failure Rate** - the percentage rate of code changes that require hotfixes after production.
3. **Defects found after release to customers** - bugs found after the release to the customers
4. **Mean Time to Detect** - mean amount of time it takes for the team to discover or detect an incident.
5. **Defects found during development** - bugs found during development

### **Other Metrics**

1. **Percentage of Uptime -** gives you an idea of the percentage of the total time that the processes are actually active
2. **Lead time for changes** - from the request to the client getting the value
3. **Setup Time** - is the amount of time needed to prepare for a given step
4. **Takt time** - is the maximum amount of time the team needs to comply to meet the client demands
5. **Deployment Frequency** - frequency of the new code is deployed into production
6. **Mean Time to Failures** - the average time between repairable failures.
7. **Mean Time to Recover** - measure how long it takes to recover from a partial service interruption or total failure
8. **Mean Time to Repair** - is the average time it takes to fix an application
9. **Mean Time to Resolve** - is the average time it takes to completely fix an application that makes sure it does not repeat again.
10. **Mean Time to Acknowledge** - is the average from detection to the start of working it.
