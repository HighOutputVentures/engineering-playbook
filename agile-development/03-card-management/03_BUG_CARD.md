# BUG CARD

## What is a Bug?
It is a problem that impairs a product or a service's functionality.

## Naming title guidelines
Naming the title for a bug card should help developers point out a specific problem.

We can format the bug card, like these:
1. `<persona / type of user>` `<contraction>` `<perform action>`
2. `<system feature> should <expected behavior> but doesn't`
3. `<persona / type of user> <gets result> but should <get different result>`

> **NOTE**: There are several ways to format title for a bug card. 
> 
> Please see [Naming Bug Cards](https://stratejos.ai/blog/naming-task-bug-user-story-titles/)

For example:

New user can't view homescreen

Member should not be able to see the other member's status.

## Writing a description guidelines
Add more details to guide the developer(s), like screen shots and narrowing down scenarios.

For example:

New user can't view homescreen when certain events

Add actual result and the expected result.
