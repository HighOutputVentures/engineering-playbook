# Pull System Task Assignment

## Overview

It's a Lean Technique for reducing waste of any production process.

In other words, it lets you consume only when you have a demand, at the right time.

Teams pull work as they finish what they started while keeping their focus on the highest priorities.

### Why?

It is to build products based on actual demand and not on forecasts.

### Goals

1. Reduce waste of resources
2. Scaling the optimal capacity of the team
3. Deliver on-demand items faster
4. To be predictable

### Checklist

* [ ] \- Add ruleset for the project's pull system. For example, don't pull any cards if the assigned card is not `Done` yet.
* [ ] \- Limit work in progress or add limit to necessary columns in board
* [ ] \- Add indicators where the card is ready for pulling. For example, cards under `To Do` are refined and ready for development.
* [ ] \- Apply regular retrospective, to identify existing wastes and achieve ideal team workflow.
* [ ] \- Add `Swimlanes` and `Components` to categorize responsibilities when pulling a task.

> **⚠️ TAKE NOTE:**
>
> Pulling a task means that anyone can just pull any task, there are cases where a specific devs have a specialize knowledge that fit to solve that task
>
> You can make use of the Brown Bag Session so that the solution could be shared throughout the team.
