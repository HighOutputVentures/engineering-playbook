# Daily Standup

## Overview

The stand-up is a time-boxed ceremony that is held each day of the sprint. In this ceremony, each contributor in the Development Team will answer three simple project questions and an optional social question. This will repeat until each contributor has answered the following questions.

### ðŸ¥… Goals

1. Bring awareness of the progress done towards the sprint goal, and the sprint backlog.
2. Surface any impediments to one or more team members' contributions.
3. Maintain contact between remote team members to reduce social barriers to collaboration.

### Participation

The entire team should attend the stand-up. Anyone that worked on a task towards the sprint work should answer the three questions. It would be up to the team to decide if they would like updates from members that are not directly working against sprint task work (i.e. Product Owners and Project Manager).
