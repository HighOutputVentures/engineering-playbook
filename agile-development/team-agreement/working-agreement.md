# Working Agreement

## Working Agreement

A working agreement is a document that describes how we work together as a team and what our expectations and principles are.

### General

* We work as one team towards a common goal and clear scope
* We make sure everyone's voice is heard, listened to

### Communication

* We add all documentation to the project repository

### Backlog Management

* We follow the Definition of Ready when we move it to `To Do`
* We make our work visible through work
* We assign ourselves a task when we are ready to work for it. and move it to `In Progress`
* We follow the Definition of Done when closing cards
* If add a sub-task card, we make sure it matches the acceptance criteria of the user story, to avoid scope creep.

### Code Management

*   We follow the git flow's naming of branches

    For example:

    `feature/add-add-user-api-endpoint`
* We merge through PRs
* We treat documentation as code and apply the same standards
