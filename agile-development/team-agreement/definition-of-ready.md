# Definition of Ready

When the development team picks a user story from the top of the backlog, the user story needs to have enough detail to estimate the work needed to complete the story within the sprint. If it has enough detail to estimate, it is Ready to be developed.

> **ðŸ’¡ Advisory Note:**
>
> If a user story is not Ready in the beginning of the Sprint it increases the chance that the story will not be done at the end of this sprint.

To help team members to ensure that the user story they wrote contains all the necessary details for the scrum team to understand the work to be done.

* [ ] \- Does the user story have clear and complete acceptance criteria?
* [ ] \- Does the user story address the business needs?
* [ ] \- Is the user story small enough to be implemented in a short amount of time, but large enough to provide value to the customer?
* [ ] \- Is the user story blocked? For example, does it depend on the following:
  * A deliverable provided by another team
  * incomplete work

### When should a Definition of Ready be updated

### What should be avoided

The `Definition of Ready` the checklist covers items that apply in a general. **Don't add items or details that only apply to one or two user stories**.
