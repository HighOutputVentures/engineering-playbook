### General Guidance

1. Set the stage
2. Gather data
3. Generate insights
4. Decide what to do
5. Close the retrospective.

### Project Retrospectives

### Iteration Retrospective

Iteration reviews should follow the ceremony of the retrospective script, but using less time and fewer activities than the project or milestone retrospective. Iteration (sprint) retrospectives will focus more on execution and implementation details and how the team can improve execution for future iterations.
