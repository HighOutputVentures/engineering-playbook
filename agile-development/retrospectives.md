### ðŸ¥… Goals

1. Continually learn from our engagement, improving our ability to deliver to our customers.
2. Involve everyone in the learning and improvement.
3. The dev team and the larger org learn from each engagement.

### General Guidance

1. Set the stage
2. Gather data
3. Generate insights
4. Decide what to do
5. Close the retrospective.

### Project/Milestone Retrospectives

This is the most strict and intense retrospective and everyone is expected to attend this meeting. The goal of this retrospective is to identify proposed changes that the team might try in the next project/milestone. It usually covers the following examples:

1. How did the development phase went?
2. How did the operations team collaborate with the product team?
3. How well did the product engineering engage?
4. How well did the team respond to any changes?

It usually takes time at least an hour (1 hour) and it depends on how complex the project/milestone was and how many people were involved in the retrospective.
