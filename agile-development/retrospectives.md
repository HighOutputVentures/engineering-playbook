Conducts agile retrospective for each iteration and project milestone.

## ðŸ¥… Goals

1. Continually learn from our engagement, improving our ability to deliver to our customers.
2. Involve everyone in the learning and improvement.
3. The dev team and the larger org learn from each engagement.

### General Guidance

1. Set the stage
2. Gather data
3. Generate insights
4. Decide what to do
5. Close the retrospective.

### Project Retrospectives

### Iteration Retrospective

Iteration reviews should follow the ceremony of the retrospective script but use less time and fewer activities than the project or milestone retrospective. Iteration (sprint) retrospectives will focus more on execution and implementation details and how the team can improve execution for future iterations.
