# User Story Mapping
> It is a dead simple idea. Talk about the user's journey through your product by building a simple model that tells your user's story as you do.

<b>User Story Mapping</b> helps Agile team define what to build and maintain visibility for how it all fits together. They enable user-centered conversations, collaboration, and feature prioritization to align and guide iterative product development.

Motivation on why we need to use this and why is this beneficial for us.
1. **It puts the individuals working on it first** over what processes we incorporate and tools we should use.
2. **It helps us distinguish minimum requirements** over long-winded documentation about functionalities and requirements.
3. **Shortens feedback loop** by reducing chains of information.
4. **Quicky adapts** due to fast feedback, competitive analysis and product maturity.
5. **Identifying loopholes** due to not seeing the full picture of how the product is used.
6. A practice for **categorization, prioritization and refinement**

### Benefits
The following are some of the ways that story mapping helps team improve their processes for building products that the user love.

- **Focuses on user value**

We know which interactions we should release

- **Prioritizes the right work**

Prioritize high value targets

- **Drives clear, well-sized requirements**

We can define requirements that are well placed

- **Delivers new value early and often**

Due to having a well-sized requirements you can add value and iterate faster.

- **Exposes risks and dependencies**

Due to collaboration we can know what risk is going to take, redundancy to eliminate, etc.

- **Builds team consensus**

For each story we made we can have an agreement on several things like, what to prioritize, correct steps/flow, and etc.

### Define the Right Product Owner

Product Owner should know what he wants, what the customer want at first, expectation he wants, etc.
### Build an Empathetic Developer Team

Increase level of empathy for what the customer is trying to accomplish.

### How does user story mapping work
1. **Frame the problem**
Build a backbone, core ideas that made the product. Discussed with the PO and PD

**Example**:
      1. Authentication
      2. User Management
      3. Project Management


1. **Understand the product's users**

It is better to determine different types of users or personas early on

If the product's main users are for the blind people then you should carefully for accessibility.

3. **Map user activities**

Break down the backbone into a series of steps to complete

4. **Map user stories**

Add discrete interactions to complete the above step.

5. **Flow and prioritize**

Repesent colors and divide by swimlanes to indicate the value of that said stories

6. **Identify gaps, dependencies, technical requirements, and alternatives**

Collaborate with other members to enrich and validate the story map

7. **Plan for the prioritize items**

Plan items that are the top priority for development

### What are some challenges of user story mapping
- No clear customer
- No clear problem
- Limited Utility
- Re-work and redundancy
- Usage of different tools
  
### Philosophy
- Iterative AND Incremental

### TIPS
- Refrain from using `Themes`, `Epic`, `Functions`, and `Features`.
- Identify the Opening Game (Add backbones)
- Identify the Mid Game (Add steps to complete the backbone)
- Identify the End Game (Research, game changer)

> NOTE: Story maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them.


## WHO PARTICIPATES

Anyone can participate in mapping user stories.

1. **Product Owner** should know what the customer wants.

2. **Product Designer** should know what kind of solutions he want to raise.

3. **Project Manager** is the one who set milestones, strategic roadmaps.

It is encourage to include the members when mapping the story. This will reduce loop holes

### You can spearate it by tags:
- Products
- Features
- Enhancements
- Specfications
- Requirements

1. Think
2. Write down the idea, _after thinking it_
3. Explain your idea
4. Place your idea on a card (Miro)

```
What is it?
Why build it?
What will happen?
When you do?

Desired Outcomes?
```

- List the types of Customers and Users.
- Types of users to a sentence or two about each
- Types of activities people would use the product for


1. Think of the core ideas of the product (Done by Product Owner and Product Designer)
   ```md
   # BIG STORY
   - Signing up
   - Change my service
   - Viewing my band stats
   - Working with my show calendar
   - Working with my audience
   - Viewing Promotions Online
   - Publicize Promotions
   ```
2. Think of the tasks that could complete that idea (Done by Product Designers)
   1. Focus on the breadth of the tasks that should be completed instead of the details of a certain task
   ```md
   # Viewing Promotions Online
   ```

## WHEN
1. Working on an MVP?
It is a great way to identify minimum requirements and functionality you need to test your concept.

2. Trying to Figure out how to improve on version 1.0?
A story map can visually display all of the potential enhancements you could add and help your team have quality conversations about what will most impact your users.

3. Managing your backlog a growing session?
Story mapping helps you tame the backlog by giving each item some context and forcing prioritization and grouping with a big-picture view; plus, it can highlight gaps you might have never noticed otherwise.

4. Branching out with a new product extension?
A story map will illustrate what you already have and the missing pieces youâ€™ll need to make the new functionality work just as well as your current offering.


**FIRST STEP**
Regardless of whether your product is still theoritical or has been kicking around for decades, story mapping starts with personas -- you must know who will be using your product and what they're trying to accomplish.


## STORY MAPPING MYTHS
1. It has an end goal.
2. It eliminates loopholes.
3. It enables seamless collaboration.

### It has an end goal
Mapping stories are continuous. It will never be "done".

As we complete the steps, new ones get prioritized and additional steps are getting added.

Meanwhile, user feedback and competitve analysis uncover new requirements.

So whether you leave your story map up/out and update it or rebuild it from scratch periodically, the "backbone" and "key steps" remain part of the process.

### It eliminates loopholes

### It enables seamless collaboration


## User Story Mapping as Backlog Refinement
1. Arrange the top items on your product backlog to represent the prioritized items
2. Don't include any task lower than second-level priority on the backlog
3. Create a separate list of those lower-priority ideas and requests.
4. Re-evaluate the level one and two items on your backlog regularly
