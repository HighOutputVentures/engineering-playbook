Philosophy
- Iterative AND Incremental
- Identify the Opening Game
- Identify the Mid Game
- Identify the End Game (Research, game changer)
- Story maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them.


Product Owner should know what the customer wants.

Product Designer should know what kinds of solution he wants to raise.

Project Manager is the one who set milestones, strategic roadmaps.

It is encourage to include the members when mapping the story. This will reduce loop holes
