## Agile Manifesto
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotation
- **Responding to change** over following a paln

## User Story Mapping

### WHY
1. It paints a full picture of how a product is used, often lost in the "not seeing the forest for the trees" reality of feature development since most teams focus on specific tasks and not the "big picture" most of the time.

2. It can identify loopholes in functionality or areas to focus on since they can visually highlight gaps in the user experience.

3. Tool for prioritizing
### Benefits
The following are some of the ways that story mapping helps team improve their processes for building products that the user love.

- **Focuses on user value**

We know which interactions we should release

- **Prioritizes the right work**

Prioritize high value targets

- **Drives clear, well-sized requirements**

We can define requirements that are well placed

- **Delivers new value early and often**

Due to having a well-sized requirements you can add value and iterate faster.

- **Exposes risks and dependencies**

Due to collaboration we can know what risk is going to take, redudancy to eliminate, etc.

- **Builds team consensus**

For each story we made we can have an **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**, **Service Level Indicators (SLI)**, **Service Level Objectives(SLO)**

### Define the Right Product Owner

Product Owner should know what he wants, what the customer want at first, expectation he wants, etc.
### Build an Empathetic Developer Team

Increase level of empathy for what the customer is trying to accomplish.

### How does user story mapping work
1. **Frame the problem**
Build a backbone, core ideas that made the product. Discussed with the PO and PD

Example:
   1. Authentication
   2. User Management
   3. Project Management


2. **Understand the product's users**
It is better to determine different types of users or personas early on

If the product's main users are for the blind people then you should carefully for accessibility.

3. **Map user activities**
Break down the backbone into a series of steps to complete

4. **Map user stories**
Add discrete interactions to complete the above step.

5. **Flow and prioritize**
Repesent colors and divide by swimlanes to indicate the value of that said stories

6. **Identify gaps, dependencies, technical requirements, and alternatives**
Collaborate with other members to enrich and validate the story map

7. **Plan for the prioritize items**
Plan items that are the top priority for development

### What are some challenges of user story mapping
- No clear customer
- No clear problem
- Limited Utility
- Re-work and redundancy
- Usage of different tools
  
### Philosophy
- Iterative AND Incremental

### TIPS
- Refrain from using `Themes`, `Epic`, `Functions`, and `Features`.
- Identify the Opening Game (Add backbones)
- Identify the Mid Game (Add steps to complete the backbone)
- Identify the End Game (Research, game changer)

> NOTE: Story maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them.


## WHO PARTICIPATES

Product Owner should know what the customer wants.

Product Designer should know what kind of solutions he want to raise.

Project Manager is the one who set milestones, strategic roadmaps.

It is encourage to include the members when mapping the story. This will reduce loop holes

### You can spearate it by tags:
- Products
- Features
- Enhancements
- Specfications
- Requirements

1. Think
2. Write down the idea, _after thinking it_
3. Explain your idea
4. Place your idea on a card (Miro)

```
What is it?
Why build it?
What will happen?
When you do?

Desired Outcomes?
```

- List the types of Customers and Users.
- Types of users to a sentence or two about each
- Types of activities people would use the product for


1. Think of the core ideas of the product (Done by Product Owner and Product Designer)
   ```md
   # BIG STORY
   - Signing up
   - Change my service
   - Viewing my band stats
   - Working with my show calendar
   - Working with my audience
   - Viewing Promotions Online
   - Publicize Promotions
   ```
2. Think of the tasks that could complete that idea (Done by Product Designers)
   1. Focus on the breadth of the tasks that should be completed instead of the details of a certain task
   ```md
   # Viewing Promotions Online
   ```


## STORY MAPPING MYTHS
1. Story mapping have an end goal.
2. Story mapping eliminates loopholes.
3. Enables seamless collaboration.
