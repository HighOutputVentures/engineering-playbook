# Author's Checklist

### Describe your PR

* Give the PR a descriptive title, so that other members can easily (in one short sentence) understand what a PR is about
* Every PR should have a proper, that shows the reviewer what has been changed and why.

### Inclusion for reviewers

* Adding someone less familiar with the project or the language can aid in verifying the changes are understandable, easy to read and increase the expertise within the team.
* It is important to include reviewers from both organizations for knowledge transfer.

### Open to receiving feedback

* Resolve a comment, if the requested change has been made.
* Mark the comment as "won't fix", if you are not going to make the requested changes and provide a clear reasoning
  * If the requested change is within the scope of the task, "I'll do it later" is not an acceptable reason!
  * If the requested change is out of scope, create a new work item (task or bug) for it.
* If you don't understand a comment, ask questions in the review itself as opposed to a private chat
* If a thread gets bloated without a conclusion, have a meeting with the reviewer (call them!)

### Track progress

If the reviewers have not responded in a reasonable time (a day or two), ping them or raise the issue in a daily meeting.
