# Versioning

To achieve loosely coupled components. This will allow developers to detect breaking changes or seamless updates (rollback and new release, A/B Testing, etc) just by looking at the version number

`major.minor.patch`

* `Major` - a breaking change
* `Minor` - a backward-compatible minor change
* `Patch` - no API change, fixes, or enhancements
